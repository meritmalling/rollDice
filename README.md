This chase/mini-memory game is a work in progress.
Itâ€™s a two player game that may be a bit unbalanced.

Process:

The game board came first. This ultimately made the manipulation of elements in jQuery much harder as I had avoid deconstructing what I had built visually.

When I started on the script, I started with the limited rules of the game. 
First came how a player could move from location to location.
Then I worked on preventing players from moving illegally.
Finally, I added winning conditions.


Next Up:

Randomize starting locations and tube lines.
Adding a timer for the thief as well. This should make the game more balanced, putting pressure on both players to move in a timely manner.
Reworking the board: it would, perhaps, be better to hide and show icons instead of removing and appending them
More animations for a more fun user experience! (e.g. building the board on start)

Used: jQuery (plugins: typed, timer)
